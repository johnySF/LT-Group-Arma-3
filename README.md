<h3>Description</h3>
Source code for the Arma 3 addon found <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3096689766">here</a>.<br/>
Files are mostly config based, meaning it inherits from it's dependencies.<br/>
I'm fine with anyone using my cursed addon, as long as it stays open for others if public, and there is no fishy shenanigans with it.<br/>
<h3>TODO</h3>
• Fix T-72 crew including a soviet soldier;<br/>
• Fix L-159 not showing up on Zeus Interface;<br/>
• Add a Independent version<br/>
• Custom uniforms... Maybe?
