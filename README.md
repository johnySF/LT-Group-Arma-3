Files are mostly config based, meaning it inherits from it's dependencies, exception being the CH-53, which has a custom skin to remove the logos

<h3>Possibles updates</h3>
• Add Anti-Air vehicles/turrets<\b>
• Custom assets, such as uniforms
• Custom Insignia/Logo, so it looks nice in the menus
• Fully remove CUP mods from dependencies
