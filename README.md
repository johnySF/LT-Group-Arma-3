<h3>Description</h3>
Source code for the Arma 3 addon found <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3096689766">here</a>.<br/>
Files are mostly config based, meaning it inherits from it's dependencies.<br/>
I'm fine with anyone using my cursed addon, as long as it stays open for others if public, and there is no fishy shenanigans with it.
<br/>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
• C-130J's custom skin won't apply automatically;<br/>
• Independent HAZMAT units are using the wrong texture;<br/>
• AA units have no ammo.<br/>
